# Music-Calculator
This is a way to calculate how big your music collection will be in wavs.

## Why are you making this?
I use an ipod video from 2005 and I'd like to know how big my library will be before I start to put music on it, since I'm upgrading the storage. and I 
assume others would like to have the ability to check too.
