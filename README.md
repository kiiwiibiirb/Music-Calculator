# Music-Calculator
This is a way to calculate how big your music collection will be in multiple file formats

## Why are you making this?
I use an ipod video from 2005 and I'd like to know how big my library will be before I start to put music on it, since I'm upgrading the storage. and I 
assume others would like to have the ability to check too.

## Usage
To use it, run main.lua. The script will prompt you with the following quetions:
- How many songs are in your library?
- What file type are your songs?
- What file size? (mb or gb)
The input for file type and file size MUST be lowercase. If not, the script will not run correctly.

After answering all the questions, you will get a minimum, maximum and average overall file size for all the songs. This is useful if you haven't 
ripped/downloaded the songs and would like to know how much space it'll take up.
